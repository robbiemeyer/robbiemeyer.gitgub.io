                for the problems that affect us all. I'm always looking for new

                vWolf is a virtual moderator for the game of Werewolf. In a
                traditional game of werewolf a player must sit out to moderate.
                Using vWolf, all players can participate. It can be played at
                <a href="http://vwolf.robbiemeyer.me">vwolf.robbiemeyer.me</a>.
                The project's code can be found on my <a
                    href="https://github.com/robbiemeyer/vWolf">github</a>.

                <h4>Features</h4>
                Currently players can:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create rooms</li>
                    <li>Decide on the number of werewolves</li>
                    <li>Have their roles randomly selected</li>
                    <li>Vote out losing players</li>
                    <li>Automatically know when the game is ended</li>
                </ul>

                As the game is web based, users can connect from any device. The game was designed from
                the ground up to accommodate all types of devices so no one would have to sit out.

                <h4>Technology</h4>

                vWolf is built using HTML/CSS, Javascript and Firebase. I
                wanted the application to run fully client-side to allow for
                easy web hosting.<br> <br>

                I chose to use web technologies for the sake of portability. It
                was important to me that everyone should be able to use vWolf.
                To achieve this goal I targeted browsers from IE 9 and newer.<br><br>
                
                Firebase's real-time database allowed for easy transference of
                data between different clients. The application was designed to
                asynchronously retrieve data from the Firebase server. The
                communication is fast and responsive.  This effect is most
                noticeable when changing role counts on multiple devices at the
                same time. The website is also hosted using Firebase.<br><br>

                <img src="./img/vwolf-ingame.png" alt="vWolf interface screenshot"></img>

                <h4>The Interface</h4> 
                
                I designed the vWolf interface to be simple and
                non-intrusive. It is responsive and can function well 
                on all screen sizes.<br><br>
                
                Each page features a large action button that indicates the
                action the player can currently take. Once game events begin, a
                log appears to keep track of past events. Roles are hidden
                under a menu to defeat wandering eyes. Every player sees the
                same information - no player is given an unfair advantage. <br><br>

                I initially used wireframes to design the interface. I then
                coded and tested a 'rough' interface. The interface was then
                polished and refined. The design shifted from an interface
                centered upon interacting with player names, to a design
                focused on a single action button.  This change simplified the
                interface by providing a common interaction model for the user
                throughout the whole app. At this point the colour-scheme was
                finalized and I designed the logo. vWolf's interface was
                finished.<br>
