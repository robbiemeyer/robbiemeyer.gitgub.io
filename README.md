#Progress

I have decided to document the creation of this webpage in a separate branch. I
think it will be an interesting exercise. Having my design process public will force me
to be very deliberate in my decisions. I think I will end up with a better result.

##Goals

I am creating a personal website. It will contain a bio, links (ex. github), 
my resume and possibly a blog. I may also want to add a portfolio/some side projects.

##The plan 

- Design basic layout, plan website out
- Create a more detailed design outline of the landing page, resume page and 
  other major pages.
- Build the landing page, resume page and add links.
- Testing!
- Build any additional features (blog, portfolio, etc.)
	- These would be nice but I want a basic page up before I begin work on these
- More testing!

##Design Goals

- Simple page - I don't want to have to manage it constantly
- Clean design, easy to read
- Works well on mobile
- Clean code - I should be able to come back and work on it months after I finish
