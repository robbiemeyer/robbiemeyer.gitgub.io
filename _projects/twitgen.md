# Twitgen

[In development]

Twitgen is a project to generate tweets to mimic the tweets of a twitter user.
I decided to create this project to learn more about text generation, ML
frameworks and deploying ML models. Currently, the project consists of a
Jupyter notebook that trains a model and gernates text based off tweet data. My
goal is for the project to consist of a website that allows a user to generate
tweets from a variety of models.
